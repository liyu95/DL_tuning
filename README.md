# DL_tuning
Deep Learning model tuning experience. Some of them are summarized from Andrew Ng's course.

# Data:
1. The more, the better. 
2. Always normalize the data before feeding into the neural network. May not be helpful in increasing the performance but it would not hurt as well. Almost always helpful in increasing the learning speed.
3. The ratio of training data and testing data should be the legend 8:2 or 7:3. The world is changing. Let's go for 100:1 or even more for big data era.
